Ruby 2.5.1

Rails 5.2.3

A personal project I'm working on, just getting more comfortable with Ruby and Rails.

Notes to self: 
- Use impressionist to count page views
- Use trix for text editor

Here's the UI kit I'm using: http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/ 
Here's a great example of a forum: http://forum.azyrusthemes.com/02_topic.html 


Right now: 

- Front-end-gems has bootstrap-saas installed
- All-in-dist: I tried to just copy the whole dist file. Didn't work either (The JS didn't work)
